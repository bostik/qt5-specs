These directories contain OBS build files for modular Qt 5. This is a
work in progress, and will evolve as the modularisation and development
of Qt 5.0 progresses.

A working build order for packages is:
    - qtbase
    - qtxmlpatterns
    - qtscript
    - qtdeclarative
    - qtsystems
    - qtsvg
    - qtmultimedia
    - qtsensors
    - qtlocation
    - qtphonon
(although OBS should take care of correct order)

This package can not be built yet against split QtBase
    - qttools (BROKEN - DOES NOT BUILD YET)

QtDeclarative build assumes that it can find unmodified V8 source tree
at src/3rdparty/v8/. To generate this file, clone v8 git tree:

% git clone git://github.com/v8/v8.git

Then create the source archive:

% cd v8/ && git archive 2eaa4b29 --prefix=v8/ | gzip > \
  ../v8-sources-from-commit-2eaa4b29.tar.gz

Add this tarball in the same OBS project where you have QtDeclarative
sources. The spec file for that module will automatically unpack the
v8 sources into correct location and apply some of Qt project's own
patches on top. This way the sources will build.
