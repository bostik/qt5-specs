These directories contain OBS build files for modular Qt 5. This is a
work in progress, and will evolve as the modularisation and development
of Qt 5.0 progresses.

A working build order for packages is:
    - qtbase
    - qtxmlpatterns
    - qtscript
    - qtdeclarative
    - qtsystems
    - qtsvg
    - qtmultimedia
    - qtsensors
    - qtlocation
    - qtphonon
    - qtmultimediakit
(although OBS should take care of correct order)

This package can not be built yet against split QtBase
    - qttools (BROKEN - DOES NOT BUILD YET)
